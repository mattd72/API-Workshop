This lab focuses on the deployment and administration of Red Hat 3Scale. One deployment topology available is known as a *hybrid* approach. A *hybrid* Red Hat 3Scale deployment topology is one in which the 3Scale API gateway is self-managed in your own environment. This self-managed API gateway is in two-way communication with the hosted Red Hat 3Scale SaaS API Management Platform (AMP).
